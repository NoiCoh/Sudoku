# An interactive Sudoku game
Software project course of B.Sc of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University.

Created By : [Inbal](https://github.com/Inbalavivi) & [Noi](https://github.com/Noicoh)

**Description**: The project consists of 5 main parts:
1.The game logic.
2.The console user interface - allowing the user to edit and create new Sudoku in any size, saving and loading Sudoku from files and enter commands like undo/redo.
3.The ILP solver algorithm - used for validating the board or generate new Sudoku.
4.The random Sudoku generator.
5.The backtracking solver for determining the number of different solutions.

For the ILP solver we used the Gurobi Optimizer, an optimization solver for linear programming.
